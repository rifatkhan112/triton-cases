    # Each program_id(0) corresponds to a batch
    # We do one element [t] in that batch in parallel

    # Then we do threadIdx in [0..BLOCK_SIZE) => out[t].
    # But here we only do a single step, so each block can handle all the 'B' in parallel.

    # However, typical usage is one block = one batch, so we do a simple approach:
    # We read out[batch_id, t+1] and out[batch_id, t].
    # We'll rely on the fact that each batch is launched separately.

    # Load out[:, t] and out[:, t+1]
    # But we might want a thread for each element in the batch dimension, 
    # but B is the grid dimension, so program_id(0) = batch_id 
    # => we do a single index. That's simpler to do with a 2D approach if B is big.
    # For demonstration, let's do a 1D approach: each block => a single batch. 
    # The offset is batch_id * S. 
    # We'll do a single step for each position t in python. 
    # So the kernel is basically a no-op if we only do one index?
